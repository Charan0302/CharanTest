Q1.Mention the working of Internet Website in Terms of Front-end & Back-end Divisions

A website consists of two main divisions: the front-end and the back-end. These divisions work together to create a complete and functional website. Here's a breakdown of each division:

Front End:
1) The front-end deals with the visual and interactive elements that users see and interact with directly on the website.
2) It includes HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), which provides the structure and content of the web pages. HTML defines elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and forms.
3) CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used in conjunction with HTML to handle the presentation and styling of the website. CSS controls the visual appearance, including colors, fonts, layout, and overall design.
4) JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to the website. It enables features like form validation, animations, user input handling, and communication with the back-end. JavaScript interacts with the HTML and CSS elements to create a responsive and interactive user experience.

Back End:
1) The back-end handles the underlying processes and server-side functionalities that power the website.
2) It involves server-side programming languages such as Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP. Back-end developers use these languages to handle complex business logic, process user requests, and generate dynamic content.
3) Databases play a crucial role in the back-end. Back-end developers work with databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB to store and manage data efficiently. They write queries and interact with databases to retrieve and update information as needed.
4) The back-end code is deployed on a server, which hosts the website. The server processes user requests, executes the necessary operations, and sends back the requested information to the front-end.
5) In some cases, back-end developers create APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to facilitate communication and data exchange between different systems or services. APIs enable front-end applications or other external systems to interact with the website's data or functionality.



Q2. What are tags in HTML? Explain the each category of tag with an Example.
   
 
Headings:
<h1> to <h6>: Used for defining different levels of headings.
Example: <h1>This is a Heading</h1>

Paragraphs and Text Formatting:
p: Used to define paragraphs of text.
Example: <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

Links:
a: Used to create hyperlinks.
Example: <a href="https://www.google.com">Visit Example Website</a>

Lists:
ul: Used for creating unordered (bulleted) lists.
Example: <ul>
           <li>Item 1</li>
           <li>Item 2</li>
         </ul>

Tables:
table: Used to create tables.


   
Q3.  Explain the working Procedure of Virtual DOM.
 
1) The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a concept used in web development
frameworks like React to improve performance and opƟmize updates to the
user interface.
2) When you create a user interface in React or a similar framework, the iniƟal
render creates a virtual representaƟon of the UI known as the Virtual DOM. It's
a lightweight copy of the actual DOM.
3) Once the Virtual DOM is created, it needs to be rendered onto the actual
browser DOM so that it can be displayed to the user. This iniƟal rendering
creates the actual HTML elements and inserts them into the DOM.
4)  The Virtual DOM is a tree-like structure composed of virtual elements, which
are JavaScript objects represenƟng the HTML elements. Each virtual element
corresponds to a real DOM element. 



  
Q4. Mention some Differences between MySQL and No SQL

the key differences between MySQL and NoSQL in a clear and concise format:

MySQL:
Relational database with a structured schema.
1) Uses SQL for querying and manipulating data.
2) Follows ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
3) Suitable for applications with structured data and complex relationships.
4) Provides strong data consistency.
  
NoSQL:
Non-relational database with a flexible schema.
1) Utilizes various query languages or APIs.
2) Sacrifices strong data consistency for scalability and performance.
3) Suitable for unstructured or semi-structured data and high scalability scenarios.
4) Provides eventual consistency and horizontal scalability.


Q5. Explain any one DBMS Technology in your own words.
 
DBMS Technology:
1) DBMS stands for Database Management System.
2) It is software that helps organize and retrieve data from databases.
3) DBMS provides structured storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data.
4) It ensures data integrity, concurrency control, and security.
5) DBMS systems use query languages (e.g., SQL) to interact with databases.
6) They are used in various applications to efficiently manage and retrieve data.
